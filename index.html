    <h1>My name is Nairitya Ganguly</h1>
    <p>I'm currently exploring the world of web development and honing my programming skills. I find joy in creating dynamic websites that offer great user experiences.</p>
    <p>In addition to coding, I enjoy learning about design principles and how they enhance the overall aesthetics of a site. I'm always looking for new challenges to further my understanding.</p>
    <p>When I'm not in front of a computer, you can find me going for nature walk or diving into a good documentary series. I believe in balancing work with personal interests for a well-rounded life.</p>
